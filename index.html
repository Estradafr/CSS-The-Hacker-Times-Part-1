            Steve Jobs' worn-out Birkenstocks sell for $218,000 at auction

            Sandals worn by Steve Jobs in the early days of Apple sold for
            $218,750 at an auction in New York City on Sunday.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sandals came from the collection of Mark Sheff, who managed
            Jobs' Albany, Calif., estate in the 1980s. Other items associated
            with Jobs have been sold at auctions in recent years, sometimes
            reaching hefty prices â€” an Apple-1 Computer prototype from the
            mid-1970s fetched $677,196.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sandals were previously sold for a mere $2,000 at auction in
            2016, Nolan said.

            James Webb telescope spots galaxies near the dawn of time, thrilling
            scientists
          </h4>

          />
          <p>
            New baby pictures of the universe, taken by the James Webb Space
            Telescope, show that galaxies started forming faster and earlier
            than expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            The telescope launched back in December and it now orbits the sun
            about a million miles away from Earth. Its giant mirror allows it to
            detect faint light that's been traveling for almost the entire
            history of the 13.8 billion-year-old universe. That means it can
            effectively see what galaxies looked like way back in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The snapshots captured so far have both thrilled and perplexed
            scientists, because it turns out that many luminous galaxies existed
            when the universe was very young.

          <p>
            The Speedb open-source project is a high-performance NoSQL database
            that is optimized for speed and scalability. It is designed to
            handle large scale data workloads and provides a variety of features
            to make it easy to use and manage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project is maintained by Speedb and forked from Rocksdb,
            developed by Facebook. <br />
            The project uses Sorted Hash Memtable, a data structure in SpeedDB
            that is used to store data in memory. It is designed to be fast and
            efficient, and it is used to improve the performance of the
            database.
